// DJANGO GAME COLLECTOR //

// Concept //

  I own a lot of games, and specifically board games. So when thinking about a collection, this was the first that came to mind.
When considering what I could improve about my collection, keeping a play history with the dinky score pads frequently provided
was the biggest point of contempt.

  Usually, a game is nicely packaged, with little bags for each piece, the rule book neatly
on top, etc. Then you get to the bottom and usually there is a whirlwind of little paper slips with barely legible (due to my
horrible handwriting) scores on them. So that's how I decided on my project: a board game manager with a history of when the
game was played and who won.

// Technologies //

  Django
  PSQL
  Bootstrap
  JavaScript/jQuery (also for Bootstrap)
  Git
  GitHub
  Heroku

// Framework //

  I am abysmal at developing frameworks. What I prefer to do is come up with the idea in my head, and before it can leak out of
my ears I'll start to work on it. So it's usually done with little thought, and after the fact.

  Here is a generic mock-up of how I wanted it to look. (Pause to find tab.)

// Stretch Goals //

  Originally, I wanted the user to be able to add players as they saw fit, then get them to show up as choices when adding to a
session. This turned out to be a larger undertaking than I expected, however, so I rolled back to a previous working commit where
the choices were predefined (my wife and two good friends).

  In the future, I fully expect to implement this, as well as some better styling, and the ability to add a url for a "How to Play"
video.
